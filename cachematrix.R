## This file consists of a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
